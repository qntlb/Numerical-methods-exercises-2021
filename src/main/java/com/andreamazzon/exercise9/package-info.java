/**
 * In this package we take care of a first, quite rough construction of a
 * Brownian motion discretization and simulation. Moreover -and the Brownian
 * motion construction is based on that- we write a class to wrap an array of
 * doubles representing a sample of realizations of a random variable into an
 * object standing for the random variable.
